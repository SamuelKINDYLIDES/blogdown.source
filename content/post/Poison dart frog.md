## Colorful but deadly

**General description**

Poison dart frog is the name commonly given to a group of frogs belonging to the family **Dendrobatidae**. They are mostly found in tropical rainforests like in Central and South America but many of them are threatened due to human activity and deforestation. They only measure up to a couple of centimeters in length.

The **Dendrobatidae** family is composed of two sub-families, being the Colostethinae sub-family and the Dendrobatinae sub-family. Dendrobatinae frogs, on the one hand, are brightly colored and their colourful patterns are directly linked to their toxicity, making them aposematic. Aposematism is a characteristic used to warn potential predators of an animal's toxicity. On the other hand, Colostethinae frogs are cryptically colored, meaning they have a coloration that grants them a sort of camouflage. These frogs are therefore not toxic.

The poison dart frog gets its name from Amerindian culture where the frog's toxic secretions were used to coat the tip of blowdarts.
